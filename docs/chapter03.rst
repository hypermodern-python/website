In this third installment of the Hypermodern Python series, I’m going to
discuss how to add linting, code formatting, and static analysis to your
project. [1]_ Previously, we discussed `Automated
Testing <../hypermodern-python-02-testing>`__. (If you start reading
here, you can also
`download <https://github.com/cjolowicz/hypermodern-python/archive/chapter02.zip>`__
the code for the previous chapter.)

Linting with Flake8
-------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote02.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote02.jpg” >}}

Linters analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic
errors, and suspicious constructs. The most common ones for Python are
`pylint <https://www.pylint.org>`__ and the linter aggregators
`flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org>`__,
`pylama <https://github.com/klen/pylama>`__, and
`prospector <https://prospector.readthedocs.io/>`__. There are also
multi-language linter frameworks such as
`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ and
`coala <https://coala.io/#/home?lang=Python>`__. In this chapter, we use
Flake8 and pre-commit.

Add a Nox session to run Flake8 on your codebase:

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   locations = "src", "tests", "noxfile.py"


   @nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
   def lint(session):
       args = session.posargs or locations
       session.install("flake8")
       session.run("flake8", *args)

By default, we run Flake8 on three locations: the package source tree,
the test suite, and ``noxfile.py`` itself. You can override this by
passing specific source files, separated from Nox’s own options by
``--``. The
`session.install <https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/config.html#nox.sessions.Session.install>`__
method installs Flake8 into the virtual environment via
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`__.

Flake8 glues together several tools. The messages produced by these
tools are assigned error codes, prefixed by one or more letters. The
prefixes group the errors into so-called violation classes:

-  ``F`` are errors reported by
   `pyflakes <https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes>`__, a tool which parses
   source files and finds invalid Python code.
-  ``W`` and ``E`` are warnings and errors reported by
   `pycodestyle <https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle>`__, which checks
   your Python code against some of the style conventions in `PEP
   8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.
-  ``C`` are violations reported by
   `mccabe <https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe>`__, which checks the code
   complexity of your Python package against a configured limit.

Configure Flake8 using the ``.flake8`` configuration file, enabling all
the built-in violation classes and setting the complexity limit:

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   select = C,E,F,W
   max-complexity = 10

By default, Nox runs all sessions defined in ``noxfile.py``. Use the
`--session
(-s) <https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/usage.html#specifying-one-or-more-sessions>`__
option to restrict it to a specific session:

.. code:: sh

   nox -rs lint

There are many `awesome Flake8
extensions <https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions>`__.
Some of these will be presented in later sections.

Code formatting with Black
--------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote03.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote03.jpg” >}}

The next addition to our toolbox is
`Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__, the uncompromising Python code
formatter. One of its greatest features is its lack of configurability.
Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you’re reading.

Adding Black as a Nox session is straightforward:

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   @nox.session(python="3.8")
   def black(session):
       args = session.posargs or locations
       session.install("black")
       session.run("black", *args)

With the Nox session in place, you can reformat your code like this:

.. code:: sh

   $ nox -rs black

   nox > Running session black
   nox > Creating virtual environment (virtualenv) using python3.8 in .nox/black
   nox > pip install black
   nox > black src tests noxfile.py
   All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
   5 files left unchanged.
   nox > Session black was successful.

Invoking ``nox`` without arguments triggers all the sessions, including
Black. It would be better to only validate the coding style without
modifying the conflicting files. Exclude Black from the sessions run by
default, by setting ``nox.options.sessions`` at the top:

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   nox.options.sessions = "lint", "tests"

Instead, check adherence to the Black code style inside the linter
session. The `flake8-black <https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-black>`__
plugin generates warnings if it detects that Black would reformat a
source file:

{{< highlight python “hl_lines=5” >}} # noxfile.py
@nox.session(python=[“3.8”, “3.7”]) def lint(session): args =
session.posargs or locations session.install(“flake8”, “flake8-black”)
session.run(“flake8”, \*args) {{< /highlight >}}

Configure Flake8 to enable the ``flake8-black`` warnings, which are
prefixed by ``BLK``. Also, some built-in warnings do not align well with
Black. You need to ignore warnings ``E203`` (*Whitespace before ‘:’*),
and ``W503`` (*Line break before binary operator*), and set the maximum
line length to a more permissive value:

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   select = BLK,C,E,F,W
   ignore = E203,W503
   max-line-length = 88

Checking imports with flake8-import-order
-----------------------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote04.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote04.jpg” >}}

The
`flake8-import-order <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order>`__
plugin checks that import statements are grouped and ordered in a
consistent and `PEP
8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`__-compliant way.
Imports should be arranged in three groups, like this:

.. code:: python

   # standard library
   import time

   # third-party packages
   import click

   # local packages
   from hypermodern_python import wikipedia

Install the plugin in the linter session:

{{< highlight python “hl_lines=5” >}} # noxfile.py
@nox.session(python=[“3.8”, “3.7”]) def lint(session): args =
session.posargs or locations session.install(“flake8”, “flake8-black”,
“flake8-import-order”) session.run(“flake8”, \*args) {{< /highlight >}}

Enable the warnings emitted by the plugin (``I`` like *import*).

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   select = BLK,C,E,F,I,W

Inform the plugin about package names which are considered local:

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   application-import-names = hypermodern_python,tests

Adopt the `Google
styleguide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Imports_formatting#313-imports-formatting>`__
with respect to the grouping and ordering details:

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   import-order-style = google

Recommending an import linter in 2020 is not an easy task, as there is
currently a lot of movement in this area. The excellent plugin
recommended in this section has been placed in `maintenance
mode <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order/issues/163#issuecomment-468923340>`__.
An alternative is `isort <https://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/>`__,
which comes with Flake8 integration via
`flake8-isort <https://github.com/gforcada/flake8-isort>`__ and
additionally supports rewriting files. isort enjoys widespread
popularity, but has also attracted much
`criticism <https://github.com/psf/black/issues/333#issuecomment-414123095>`__
(which its author `intends to
address <https://github.com/psf/black/issues/333#issuecomment-490241054>`__
in the upcoming major release). If you are looking for a tool to rewrite
imports, you should also have a look at
`asottile/reorder-python-imports <https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports>`__
and
`sqlalchemyorg/zimports <https://github.com/sqlalchemyorg/zimports>`__.

Finding more bugs with flake8-bugbear
-------------------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote05.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote05.jpg” >}}

The `flake8-bugbear <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear>`__ plugin
helps you find various bugs and design problems in your programs. Add
the plugin to the linter session in your ``noxfile.py``:

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   @nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
   def lint(session):
       args = session.posargs or locations
       session.install("flake8", "flake8-black", "flake8-bugbear", "flake8-import-order")
       session.run("flake8", *args)

Enable the plugin warnings in Flake8’s configuration file (``B`` like
*bugbear*):

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   select = B,B9,BLK,C,E,F,I,W

``B9`` is required for Bugbear’s more opinionated warnings, which are
disabled by default. In particular, ``B950`` checks the maximum line
length like the built-in ``E501``, but with a tolerance margin of 10%.
Ignore the built-in error ``E501`` and set the maximum line length to a
sane value:

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   ignore = E203,E501,W503
   max-line-length = 80

Identifying security issues with Bandit
---------------------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote06.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote06.jpg” >}}

`Bandit <https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit>`__ is a tool designed to find
common security issues in Python code. Install it via the
`flake8-bandit <https://github.com/tylerwince/flake8-bandit>`__ plugin:

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   @nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
   def lint(session):
       args = session.posargs or locations
       session.install(
           "flake8",
           "flake8-bandit",
           "flake8-black",
           "flake8-bugbear",
           "flake8-import-order",
       )
       session.run("flake8", *args)

Enable the plugin warnings in Flake8’s configuration file (``S`` like
*security*):

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   select = B,B9,BLK,C,E,F,I,S,W
   ...

Bandit flags uses of ``assert`` to enforce interface constraints because
assertions are removed when compiling to optimized byte code. You should
disable this warning for your test suite, as Pytest uses assertions to
verify expectations in tests:

.. code:: ini

   # .flake8
   [flake8]
   per-file-ignores = tests/*:S101
   ...

Bandit finds known issues that can be detected via static file checking.
If you are very concerned with security, you should consider using
additional tools, for example a fuzzing tool such as
`python-afl <https://github.com/jwilk/python-afl>`__.

Finding security vulnerabilities in dependencies with Safety
------------------------------------------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote09.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote09.jpg” >}}

`Safety <https://github.com/pyupio/safety>`__ checks the dependencies of
your project for known security vulnerabilities, using a curated
database of insecure Python packages. Add the following Nox session to
run Safety on your project:

.. code:: python

   import tempfile


   @nox.session(python="3.8")
   def safety(session):
       with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as requirements:
           session.run(
               "poetry",
               "export",
               "--dev",
               "--format=requirements.txt",
               "--without-hashes",
               f"--output={requirements.name}",
               external=True,
           )
           session.install("safety")
           session.run("safety", "check", f"--file={requirements.name}", "--full-report")

The session uses the `poetry
export <https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#export>`__ command to
convert Poetry’s lock file to a `requirements
file <https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files>`__,
for consumption by Safety. The standard
`tempfile <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html>`__ module is
used to create a temporary file for the requirements.

Include Safety in the default Nox sessions by adding it to
``nox.options.sessions``:

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   nox.options.sessions = "lint", "safety", "tests"

To see how Safety works, install the infamous
`insecure-package <https://pypi.org/project/insecure-package/>`__:

.. code:: sh

   poetry add insecure-package

Here’s what Safety has to say about this:

.. code:: sh

   $ nox -rs safety

   nox > Running session safety
   nox > Re-using existing virtual environment at .nox/safety.
   nox > poetry export --dev --format=requirements.txt --without-hashes --output=/var/folders/13/g258r36n3fd7rj0jrgln5gd04dw8n3/T/tmpkgcb549m

Managing dependencies in Nox sessions with Poetry
-------------------------------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote07.jpg”
link=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote07.jpg” >}}

In this section, I describe how to use Poetry to manage development
dependencies in your Nox sessions, and how to make your Nox sessions
more reproducible.

In the `first chapter <../hypermodern-python-01-setup>`__, we saw that
Poetry writes the exact version of each package dependency to a file
named ``poetry.lock``. The same is done for development dependencies
like ``pytest``. This is known as *pinning*, and it allows you to build
and test your package in a predictable and deterministic way.

By contrast, this is how we have been installing packages into Nox
sessions so far:

.. code:: python

   session.install("flake8")

No version specified! Nox will install whatever pip considers the latest
version when the session is run. The checks may succeed when you run
them on your local machine, but suddenly break on another developer’s
machine or on a Continuous Integration server, due to a change to Flake8
or one of its dependencies. These things happen all the time, and the
problem accumulates quickly as the dependencies of your project grow.

You could pin Flake8 using something like the following:

.. code:: python

   session.install("flake8==3.7.9")

This approach improves the situation, but it has some limitations:

-  We’re back to handling requirements manually, rather than using
   Poetry’s rich support for dependency management.
-  The check is still not deterministic, because dependencies of
   dependencies remain unpinned. (Flake8 is a good example for this: At
   its core, it aggregates several more specialized tools. While Flake8
   `protects you from breaking
   changes <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/faq.html#why-does-flake8-use-ranges-for-its-dependencies>`__
   to these tools, their exact versions are still left to chance.)

How about we declare Flake8 as a *development dependency* of our
project, like we did with Pytest in the previous chapter? Then we can
benefit from Poetry as a dependency manager, and record the versions of
Flake8 and its dependencies in its lock file. – Well, there is a catch.
Look how we installed development dependencies in the Nox session for
testing:

.. code:: python

   session.run("poetry", "install", external=True)

This command installs a bunch of things our linting session does not
need:

-  the package under development
-  the package dependencies
-  unrelated development dependencies (e.g. Pytest)

A major difference between testing and linting is that you need to
install your package to be able to run the test suite, but you don’t
need to install your package to run linters on it. Linters are *static
analysis tools*, they don’t need to run your program.

Wouldn’t it be great if you could install individual packages with
``session.install``, but somehow use Poetry’s lock file to constrain
their versions? Fortunately, there is a pip feature that let’s you do
exactly this: `constraints
files <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files>`__.
If you have used a ``requirements.txt`` file before, the format is
exactly the same. And Poetry has a command to export its lock file to
requirements format. So we have all the building blocks for a solution.

The function ``install_with_constraints`` below is a wrapper for
``session.install``. It generates a constraints file by running `poetry
export <https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#export>`__, and passes that
file to pip using its ``--constraint`` option. The function uses the
standard `tempfile <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html>`__
module to create a temporary file for the constraints.

.. code:: python

   # noxfile.py
   def install_with_constraints(session, *args, **kwargs):
       with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as requirements:
           session.run(
               "poetry",
               "export",
               "--dev",
               "--format=requirements.txt",
               f"--output={requirements.name}",
               external=True,
           )
           session.install(f"--constraint={requirements.name}", *args, **kwargs)

Change the Nox sessions to call the ``install_with_constraints`` wrapper
instead of invoking ``session.install`` directly:

.. code:: python

   @nox.session(python="3.8")
   def black(session):
       args = session.posargs or locations
       install_with_constraints(session, "black")
       session.run("black", *args)


   @nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
   def lint(session):
       args = session.posargs or locations
       install_with_constraints(
           session,
           "flake8",
           "flake8-bandit",
           "flake8-black",
           "flake8-bugbear",
           "flake8-import-order",
       )
       session.run("flake8", *args)


   @nox.session(python="3.8")
   def safety(session):
       with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as requirements:
           session.run(
               "poetry",
               "export",
               "--dev",
               "--format=requirements.txt",
               "--without-hashes",
               f"--output={requirements.name}",
               external=True,
           )
           install_with_constraints(session, "safety")
           session.run("safety", "check", f"--file={requirements.name}", "--full-report")

You can now use Poetry to manage Black, Flake8, and the other tools as
development dependencies:

.. code:: sh

   poetry add --dev \
       black \
       flake8 \
       flake8-bandit \
       flake8-black \
       flake8-bugbear \
       flake8-import-order \
       safety

You should also adapt the testing session. That session only needs
packages required for running the test suite, and should not be
cluttered by anything else. Instead of simply invoking
``poetry install``, pass the ``--no-dev`` option. This excludes
development dependencies, and installs only the package itself and its
dependencies. Then install the test requirements explicitly using
``install_with_constraints``. Here is the rewritten Nox session:

.. code:: python

   @nox.session(python=["3.8", "3.7"])
   def tests(session):
       args = session.posargs or ["--cov", "-m", "not e2e"]
       session.run("poetry", "install", "--no-dev", external=True)
       install_with_constraints(
           session, "coverage[toml]", "pytest", "pytest-cov", "pytest-mock"
       )
       session.run("pytest", *args)

Your linter checks are now deterministic, and your Nox sessions benefit
from Poetry’s convenient and reliable dependency management. ✌

Managing Git hooks with pre-commit
----------------------------------

{{< figure src=“/images/hypermodern-python-03/cote08.jpg”

Git provides
`hooks <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks>`__
which allow you to run custom commands when important actions occur,
such as a commit or push. You can leverage this to run automated checks
when you commit changes. `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ is a
framework for managing and maintaining such hooks. Use it to integrate
the best industry standard linters into your workflow, even those
written in a language other than Python.

Install pre-commit via `pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__ or
`pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`__:

.. code:: sh

   pip install --user --upgrade pre-commit

Configure pre-commit using the ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` configuration
file, in the top-level directory of your repository. Let’s start with
the following sample configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   repos:
   -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
       rev: v2.3.0
       hooks:
       -   id: check-yaml
       -   id: end-of-file-fixer
       -   id: trailing-whitespace
   -   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
       rev: 19.3b0
       hooks:
       -   id: black

Install the hooks by running the following command:

.. code:: sh

   pre-commit install

The hooks run automatically every time you invoke ``git commit``,
applying checks to any newly created or modified files. When you add new
hooks (like just now), you can trigger them manually for all files using
the following command:

.. code:: sh

   $ pre-commit run --all-files

   [INFO] Initializing environment for https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.
   [INFO] Initializing environment for https://github.com/psf/black.
   [INFO] Installing environment for https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.
   [INFO] Once installed this environment will be reused.
   [INFO] This may take a few minutes...
   [INFO] Installing environment for https://github.com/psf/black.
   [INFO] Once installed this environment will be reused.
   [INFO] This may take a few minutes...
   Check Yaml....................................................Passed
   Fix End of Files..............................................Failed
   - hook id: end-of-file-fixer
   - exit code: 1
   - files were modified by this hook

   Fixing LICENSE

   Trim Trailing Whitespace......................................Passed
   black.........................................................Passed

As you can see from the output, the ``end-of-file-fixer`` hook failed
because the license file was missing a final newline. The hook already
appended the missing newline to the file, so you can simply commit the
file:

.. code:: sh

   git commit --message="Fix missing newline at end of LICENSE" LICENSE

There is a problem though: The sample configuration pins Black to a
specific version, and so does Poetry’s lock file. This setup requires
you to keep the versions aligned manually, and can result in failed
checks when the environments managed by pre-commit, Poetry, and Nox
drift apart.

Let’s replace the Black entry using a `repository-local
hook <https://pre-commit.com/#repository-local-hooks>`__, and run Black
in the development environment created by Poetry:

.. code:: yaml

   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   repos:
   -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
       rev: v2.3.0
       hooks:
       -   id: check-yaml
       -   id: end-of-file-fixer
       -   id: trailing-whitespace
   -   repo: local
       hooks:
       -   id: black
           name: black
           entry: poetry run black
           language: system
           types: [python]

This method allows you to rely on Poetry to manage development
dependencies, without worrying about version mismatch caused by other
tools.

Use the same technique to run Flake8 from the pre-commit hook:

.. code:: yaml

   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   -   repo: local
       hooks:
       -   id: black
           ...
       -   id: flake8
           name: flake8
           entry: poetry run flake8
           language: system
           types: [python]

The checks run somewhat faster than the corresponding Nox sessions, for
two reasons:

-  They only run on files changed by the commit in question.
-  They assume that the tools are already installed.
