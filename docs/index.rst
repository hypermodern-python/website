This article series [1]_ is a guide to modern Python tooling with a focus on
simplicity and minimalism. It walks you through the creation of a
complete Python project structure, with unit tests, static analysis,
type-checking, documentation, and continuous integration and delivery.

The guide is aimed at intermediate developers and presumes basic
knowledge of the Python programming language. You may also find it an
interesting read if you are already a seasoned Python developer, but
want to see how to implement best practices with a new generation of
Python tools. [2]_

You need a recent Linux, Unix, or Mac system with
`bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`__,
`curl <https://curl.haxx.se>`__, and `git <https://www.git-scm.com>`__
for this tutorial, or Windows 10 with `Git for
Windows <https://gitforwindows.org/>`__.

This guide has a companion repository:
`cjolowicz/hypermodern-python <https://github.com/cjolowicz/hypermodern-python>`__.
Each article in the guide corresponds to a set of commits in the GitHub
repository.

      The title of this guide is inspired by the book *Die hypermoderne
      Schachpartie* (The hypermodern chess game), written by `Savielly
      Tartakower <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savielly_Tartakower>`__ in
      1924. It surveys the revolution that had taken place in chess theory
      in the decade after the First World War.

      If you are a complete beginner, I would recommend to read
      an introductory book first, for example `Automate the Boring Stuff with
      Python <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>`__, or any of the learning
      resources listed in `The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to
      Python <https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/>`__.
